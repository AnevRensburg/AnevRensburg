# Freelance work

I've created the following commercial websites for companies.
I specifically did not use website generating tools like wordpress and other CMS products, in order to use and develop my HTML and CSS skills.

I made use of the bootstrap css library.
All the sites were designed and implemented to be mobile-friendly.
