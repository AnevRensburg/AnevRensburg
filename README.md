# Freelance work

I've created the following commercial websites for companies.
I specifically did not use website generating tools like wordpress and other CMS products, in order to use and develop my HTML and CSS skills.

I made use of the Bootstrap CSS library.
All the sites were designed and implemented to be mobile-friendly.

### Serendipity Storage
Commercial website for a storage cabinet supplying business. The website was launched in February 2023 and is currently in use.
