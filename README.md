### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm completing my final year of high school in May 2024.

I'm currently working on a full-stack messaging application that communicates with a telegram user via a telegram bot. I'm using the MEAN stack for this project. I've also designed and implemented several commercial websites for companies.  I've also completed several software development courses.

Please see my portfolio below for detailed information and links to source code and demos.

Full-stack messaging application that communicates with a telegram user via a telegram bot.<br>
I'm building this application to make use of the various full-stack related topics that I've learned. I'm using the MEAN stack.<br>

<strong>2. Freelance Work</strong><br>

Below are websites that I designed and implemented from scratch for customers.
<br>The sites are mostly static, and I steered clear from using website generating tools like wordpress and CMS products, in order to use and develop my HTML and CSS skills.
All the sites were designed and implemented to be mobile-friendly.
<br>For styling I made use of the Bootstrap CSS library.<br>
